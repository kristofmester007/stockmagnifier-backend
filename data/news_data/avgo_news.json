            "summary": "With the Nasdaq Composite in bear market territory (marked by the index falling more than 20% from its all-time high), there is some panic in the market.  Investors are worried about the effect of tariffs on the consumer and would rather be in more conservative investments than artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, which have more upside but with more risk.  Anyone selling right now has a one-year time frame in mind, rather than the three- to five-year time frame that individual investors should have.",

            "summary": "The stock market sold off rapidly over the past few weeks, leading many to label this a stock market crash brought on by President Donald Trump's tariff announcements.  Stocks moved down sharply this week as reciprocal tariffs went into effect; they recovered quickly as Trump announced tariff relief on every country except China, but continued to mark additional losses on Thursday.  The tariffs might have some effect in the short term, but it's unlikely that they will still be the primary topic of discussion five years from now.",
