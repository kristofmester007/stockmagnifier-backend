The company maintained its full year profit outlook. Walmart is in focus: While Wall Street tries to estimate what tariffs could mean for companies, veteran retail analyst Greg Melich of EvercoreISI is estimating a worst-case scenario of tariffs on Walmart. Melich said, \"If 50% incremental [tariffs] on China and 20% rest of the world [tariffs] are maintained, AND no carrots of tax cuts or deregulation are implemented, we estimate the EPS pressure for Walmart of 2% could grow 3x higher.\" BrIIt could be the year of lost profits for companies due to tariffs: The bottom up consensus earnings per share expectation for the S&P 500 assumes 9.6% growth. Some of the biggest EPS gains are seen in tech darlings Nvidia, Broadcom, Netflix and Microsoft. But long-time strategist Adam Parker at Trivariate Research says investors no longer believe those numbers. Parker thinks the tariffs are such a headwind, investors may see NO earnings growth for the S&P 500.",
